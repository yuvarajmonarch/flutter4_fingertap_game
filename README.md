# FINGER TAP GAME

## FLUTTER DEVELOPMENT

This Flutter project is a fast-paced two-player finger tap game. Players A and B tap their respective colored areas to expand them and earn points. The first to reach the maximum screen height wins. It features responsive UI, score tracking, and a result screen with a restart option.

## Things I learnt
  - Containers
  - MaterialButton and its functions
  - Navigations
  - Navigators : push pop operations
  - Passing data via constructors
  - MediaQuery
  - Logical Thinking
